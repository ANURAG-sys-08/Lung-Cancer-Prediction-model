# Lung Cancer Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning solution to predict whether a person has lung cancer based on available clinical data. The focus was on experimenting with small datasets and evaluating model performance using common classification metrics.

## Project Overview

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection through machine learning can provide critical support for timely diagnosis.

This repository contains implementations of two classifiers:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

Due to the limited size of the dataset, the models achieved surprisingly high precision, recall, and F1-scores. Logistic Regression performed the best in this scenario.

## Dataset

- The dataset used is relatively small, which influenced the model's performance.
- It contains clinical and diagnostic features relevant to lung cancer detection.
